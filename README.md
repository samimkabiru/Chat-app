## My process

I built this component using the Bottom-up approach and also used the mobile first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this was my first time building this sort of project, i learned how to build the chat application and also how to position the texts and the images in the chat.

### Continued development

I realized at some point that my code was not clean. It was definitely able to solve the problem, but it was not the neatest way to solve that problem so i hope to continue honing my web development skills in order to write clean and semantic HTML and CSS code.
